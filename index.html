		 <ul>
		   <li>We need to have a firm desire to move forward in our lives. </li>
		   <li>The only thing that requires no effort on our part is growing in age- we cannot stop the clock from ticking.</li>
		   <li>The problem arises when there is a gap between our age and our level of maturity.</li>
		   <li>Change will happen if we allow change in our lives.</li>
		   <li>God continues to place us in positions of change.</li>
		   <li>The bible says that whatever we ask shall be given, the problem is we may not know what to ask from God.</li>
		   <li>We need to be able to grow to where we know what to ask from God.</li>
		   <li>The moment we plateau in our growth process, we start declining.</li>
		   <li>We have been created to be dynamic beings.</li>
		   <li>Moments of stagnation may be an opportunity when God making us think of our next step in life.</li>
		   <li>Today is always a preparation for tomorrow.</li>
		   <li>We have been created perfect by God and He plans to raise us from one level of glow to another.</li>
		   <li>When we compare ourselves to others, we stop growing.</li>
		   <li>It is high time we turn away from that roundabout and focus on our own paths.</li>
		   <li>God is calling us to a new level.</li>
		   <li>Let us stop dreaming of the things we cannot do and start doing the things we can do and see what God will do with us next.</li>
		   <li>Most of the times we stand on our way of growth- we do not trust ourselves enough.</li>
		 </ul>
		 <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
		 <ul>
		 <li>What is the single thing that you plan to do this year that will matter most in 10 years?</li>
		 <li>What habit would you most like to establish this year?</li>
		 </ul>

		 <h4>Growth Mindest</h4>
		 <ul>
		 <li>Not shying away from opportunities- David did not shy away from stepping up and facing Goliath (<a href = "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+17&version=NKJV" >1 Samuel 17</a>).  </li>
		 <li>Even in the midst of challenges move forward and praise the Lord (<a href = "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A2%E2%80%934&version=NKJV">James 1:2&hyphen;4</a>).</li>
		 <li>Not comparing yourself to others- Leah and Rachel</li>
		 <li>Constantly keeping a positive attitude- Reminding ourselves that we derive strength from God (<a href = "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phillipians+4%3A13&version=NKJV">Phillipians 4:13 </a>) </li>
